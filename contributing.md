6. Create a pull request: Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click on the "New pull request" button. Follow the instructions to create a pull request, explaining the changes you made and why they should be merged into the original repository.

To deploy the Flask application, you can follow these steps:

1. Choose a hosting platform: There are several hosting platforms that support Python Flask applications, such as Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and PythonAnywhere. Choose the platform that best suits your needs.

2. Create an account: Sign up for an account on the chosen hosting platform and follow the instructions to set up your account.

3. Configure the deployment settings: Each hosting platform has its own deployment settings and requirements. Consult the documentation of your chosen platform to configure the deployment settings for your Flask application.

4. Deploy the application: Once the deployment settings are configured, you can deploy your Flask application by following the instructions provided by the hosting platform. This usually involves pushing your code to a remote repository or using a command-line tool provided by the platform.

5. Test the deployed application: After the deployment process is complete, you can test your deployed Flask application by accessing the provided URL in a web browser. Make sure to test all the functionality of your application to ensure it works correctly in the deployed environment.

Remember to consult the documentation of your chosen hosting platform for detailed instructions on how to deploy a Flask application.
