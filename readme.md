# Abstract
This code is a Flask application that handles user registration, login, and image prediction for diabetic retinopathy. It uses TensorFlow and Cloudant for model loading and database operations, respectively.

### Inputs
The code takes inputs from the user through HTML forms, including registration details, login credentials, and uploaded images for prediction.

### Flow
The code defines routes for different endpoints, such as '/' for the index page, '/register' for the registration page, '/afterreg' for handling registration form submission, '/login' for the login page, '/afterlogin' for handling login form submission, '/logout' for the logout page, and '/result' for image prediction.
When a user submits the registration form, the 'afterreg' function is triggered. It checks if the user is already registered in the database and either registers the user or displays an error message.
When a user submits the login form, the 'afterlogin' function is triggered. It checks if the username exists in the database and either redirects to the prediction page or displays an error message.
When a user uploads an image for prediction, the 'res' function is triggered. It processes the image, makes a prediction using a loaded model, and renders the prediction result on the 'prediction.html' template.
Outputs
The code snippet outputs rendered HTML templates for different pages, such as the index page, registration page, login page, logout page, and prediction page. It also outputs success or error messages based on user actions, such as successful registration, login, or invalid credentials.

# Run the Flask application
Usage example
```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=80, debug=True)
```
This code starts the Flask application and runs it on the specified host and port. It enables debugging mode for easier development.
